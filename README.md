Research on the serial protocol used in Nikon film cameras like the F100.

# Why

Some Nikon film cameras (like F5, F6, F100 ...) allow you to save settings (ISO, aperture, lens ...) for each shot to an internal storage. You can compare that to modern EXIF metadata, but it's not the same technically. Nikon also sold an external device to save that data onto a CF card called MV-1. It's now very hard to get such a thing for a reasonable price.
